							<h2>Dear Aimee,</h1>
								<p class="indenta" style="line-height: 2"> Happy Valentine's Day! I want to take this as an opportunity to extend my heartfelt letter to you and appreciate you for all your kindness that you gave to me so far. I've been really enjoying each moment talking with you and I feel like every day has been the happiest day of my life with you. I want you to know that the day we met I‚Äôve fallen deeply in love with you, there are no words to express the feeling I feel in my heart that you came into my life. A day without you in my life is like a day without food and a week without ice cream. I'm jealous of everyone who gets the chance to meet you everyday. Let it be your friends. Emi or your tutor Theresa, I hate them all. I want to wake up next to you, eat breakfast with you, play video games with you, hold your hand and watch anime. Put on your choker and make you salad, study Japanese together, cuddle with you, look into your magical eyes, forget about the world, hug you tight and build blanket fort with you, watching sunrise and sunset, walk in the rain with you, sleep talking to you, never letting you go, play with your hair, kiss you goodnight, sleep in your arms and waking up in your arms! I can‚Äôt imagine not meeting you. I love how you tried my hobbies and we are really compatible with each other which made our bond tighter. I see my future self having fun with you and really just enjoying a lot of things. You‚Äôre such an amazing girl, you‚Äôre pretty, kind, passionate and very committed. Which are traits that I really like from you. What we have together is unique. It is a special bond that is strong and unbreakable. We can make it through anything we encounter and we only grow stronger from the trials we face together. Together, we are strong. Being with you has made me a better person and I can‚Äôt believe that I found you. Ever since I met you, I never want to let you go. The attraction that you and I share is one that is so intense and I never want to be separated from you. No matter how long it might take us and how far we are apart. Love has no boundary and that you will always be forever in my heart. I love your story and want me to feel included in your adventures and life. I'm really looking forward to the day that I get to experience those adventures with you in person! Though many miles may separate us, I still feel so close to you. I'm incredibly lucky to have a girl who can make me feel that way from halfway across the world! There's truly no one else in the world I would rather spend my life with. There's no doubt that distance can be hard on a relationship, but I want to reassure you that distance can never weaken my love for you. You‚Äôre forever in my heart! You mean the world to me, and it's a small wonder why you're the best thing that has ever happened to me! The day I met you was the luckiest day of my life, and I've cherished every day we've spent talking since. I promise to stay true to your standards and hold on to you forever. I‚Äôll do everything I can to make you as happy as you can be by my side. I want to be there always helping you, I want to grow with you, to see how much we can do together. I want to help you achieve your dreams and see them come to life. I want to be there for you, when it all seems too much, I want to make you smile and laugh, to experience joy every day. I want days filled with you, and I want to continue seeing you, in your weakest or your strongest, I want to be there with you. I feel like I‚Äôm the king of the world right now because I found my queen. There‚Äôs nothing much all I want in this world rather than to spend my entire life with you. You shouldn‚Äôt forget to smile, it brings happiness to me. Learn from your past, all people you had in your life, all people who played with your heart, played with your feelings. Now, it's just me, only ME. I love you from the bottom of my heart.
